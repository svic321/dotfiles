The community plugins I use the most are:
- Style settings
- restore tab key
- relative line numbers
- recent files
- code styler
- calendar

Besides that, the following settings need to be changing for working in a git repository:
- under `files and linke`:
    * unckeck 'Use wikilinks`
    * for `New link format` select `Relative path to file`
